## Important

I won't update apollo-client-rxjs to support version 2.0 of apollo-client.

```bash
npm install apollo-client-rxjs apollo-client --save
```

## Development

Running tests locally:

```
# nvm use node
npm install
npm test
```

This project uses TypeScript for static typing and TSLint for linting. You can get both of these built into your editor with no configuration by opening this project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), an open source IDE which is available for free on all platforms.
